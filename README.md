Final Project for Intro to Databases

A website for a hypothetical dog walking business. Each walker has an account
where they can enter their contact information, update their availability, view
the dogs assigned to them, and view dog information (address, owner, breed,
etc). 

Live site can be viewed at http://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~solomreb/cs290/finalProject/src/
